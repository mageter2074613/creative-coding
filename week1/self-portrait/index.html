    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>This webpage is a Self Portrait about me. Allow me to introduce myself. I am a Black African American male who is 21 years old.  I have a variety of skills and talents that have helped me develop into the person I am today. I have a tendency to actively listen, so I value understanding other people's perspectives and ideas very highly. I am a skilled multi-tasker and can manage several tasks at once effectively while making sure nothing is overlooked. While my skills and abilities extend beyond the professional realm, maintaining excellent physical fitness and excelling in sports is one of my personal goals.  On the academic front, my goals are to continue my education and earn a bachelor's degree in communication and digital studies. I am fascinated by the ever-changing world of communication and technology, and I am eager to delve into its depths. Looking ahead, my career ambitions include becoming an entrepreneur or working in the field of computer science, where I can contribute my skills and knowledge to make a significant difference.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    to the world.</p>
   <!-- 
    In this project, I wanted to create a self-portrait web page that introduces myself
    to the world. With CSS Styling I chose a simple design with a focus on readability.
    With Images I included an image that represents one of my favorite MCU characters 
    to add visual interest and provide a glimpse into my interests.
    With Data Visualization I tried to use CSS shapes and animations to represent my hobbies.
    Each hobby is supposed to be a circle, with the size of the circle meaning the time spent 
    on that hobby. I chose this to add creativity and interactivity to my webpage.
